# FullNetworkModels

FullNetworkModels.jl creates full network models using [JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) from the [PowerSystems.jl](https://nrel-siip.github.io/PowerSystems.jl) `System` built in [FullNetworkDataPrep.jl](https://gitlab.invenia.ca/invenia/research/FullNetworkDataPrep.jl).

## Notation

The notation used in the code follows the one used in [Invenia's formulation of MISO day-ahead market clearing (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ruSRtcLl9oicaJtZqWPI8S28sHW2C8Ji/view) ([editable version](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f2453fd81a39d000135af50)).
